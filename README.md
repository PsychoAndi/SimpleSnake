# SimpleSnake
A simple snake game done in PICO-8. Some comments are in the code, but i think because it is so simple, there is not much needed.

Some facts:
- 4 pixel gridsize
- animated fruit
- highscore handling
- 7 sprites needed (4xhead,1xbody,2xfruit)
- speed increases every 7 segs
- when you get rid of the debug code, the game is about 800 tokens
